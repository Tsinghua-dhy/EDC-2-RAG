Below are Three examples.\n\n##Question##:\nThe song \"Blinding Lights\" by The Weeknd was released as the 2nd single from which album and on what date?\n##Document##:\n1.\"Blinding Lights\" is a song by Canadian singer The Weeknd that was released as the second single from his fourth studio album, After Hours (2020). The song was first previewed in a Mercedes-Benz commercial on November 24, 2019, and later officially released on November 29, 2019. Produced by Max Martin and Oscar Holter, it became one of The Weeknd's biggest hits, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for four consecutive weeks and breaking numerous chart records globally. By the end of 2020, the song had amassed over 1.5 billion streams on Spotify and was named the most-streamed song of the year on the platform.\n2.The Weeknd performed \"Blinding Lights\" at several notable events, including the Super Bowl LV halftime show in February 2021. Critics have praised the song for its 80s-style synth-pop sound and emotional depth. After Hours, the album it was part of, was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 and receiving widespread critical acclaim.\n##Response##:\nThe song \"Blinding Lights\" by The Weeknd was released as the second single from the album After Hours on November 29, 2019.\n\n##Question##:\nIn which year AD did Derrick Rose's three-point shooting percentage exceed 40%?\n##Document##:\n1.In his prime in Chicago, Rose was widely considered to be one of the most athletic point guards in NBA history before a string of knee injuries slowed him down. A combination of explosiveness, leaping ability and speed allowed him to attack the basket frequently, using a repertoire of acrobatic finishes to score over taller players. Rose clocked in a maximum vertical jump of 40 inches during the 2008 NBA Combine. After the injuries, Rose compensated for his loss of athleticism by becoming more patient, methodical and creative with his shot selection, which increased his efficiency compared to his early years when he considered himself to be more \"reckless\". His control, composure and finesse helped him keep his place among the best rim finishers in the NBA in the 2019–20 season, with his 4.7 field goals made on drives coming second behind only Luka Dončić and Russell Westbrook with 4.8, while he ranked first in the league in field goal percentage on attempts from drives among players with at least 6.0 attempts with 56.4%. In the process of reinventing his game, Rose also increased his reliance on floaters, runners and push shots, leading the league in the 2020–21 season in accuracy with 53% from the field on these attempts. Due to Rose's injury history, in his later years his minutes on the court were reduced and he became more of a role player.\n2.Rose has never been a knock-down shooter from the arc, shooting 30 percent for his career. However, in the later stages of his career, he improved his shooting mechanics and managed to develop a reliable three point shot. In his second stint with the New York Knicks, Rose shot above 40 percent from three. Rose started using the bank shot more frequently and with greater success during the 2015–16 season, after struggling with his shooting due to what he attributes to depth perception issues following eye surgery in 2015.\n##Response##:\nIn his second stint with the New York Knicks, Rose shot above 40 percent from three.\n\n\##Question##:\nWhat role did Shaquille O'Neal play in Uncle Drew?\n##Documents##:\n1.Uncle Drew is a 2018 American sports comedy film directed by Charles Stone III and written by Jay Longino. It stars Kyrie Irving as the title character from his Pepsi Max advertisements that began airing in 2012, along with former NBA players Shaquille O'Neal, Chris Webber, Reggie Miller, and Nate Robinson, as well as former WNBA player Lisa Leslie. Lil Rel Howery, Erica Ash, J. B. Smoove, Mike Epps, Tiffany Haddish, Nick Kroll, and Aaron Gordon also star.2.The film was released in the United States by Lionsgate on June 29, 2018, and received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the performances of the cast, but called the direction and screenplay \"formulaic\".\n##Response##:\nNo content to extract\n\n##Question##:\n{question}\n##Documents##:\n{docs}\n##Response##:"
